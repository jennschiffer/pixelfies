real people
real selfies
real pixels
real drama

## This is an art project.

Using PHP and jQuery, `pixelfies` pixelates and showcase selfies from friends and strangers who submit. I love selfies and pixel art, so why the hell not!

## Send me your selfies

* via email [jenn@pancaketheorem.com](mailto:jenn@pancaketheorem.com) 
* via twitter [@jennschiffer](http://twitter.com/jennschiffer)
* or via pull request here!

## If sending via pull request

1. image must be 50x50 pixels and png type
2. make sure the mode is rgb
3. all you need to do is add the image to the selfies directory, no code necessary
