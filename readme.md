real people
real selfies
real pixels
real drama

## This is an art project.

Using PHP and jQuery, `pixelfies` pixelates and showcase selfies from friends and strangers who submit. I love selfies and pixel art, so why the hell not!

## Don't send me your selfies

I used to take selfies to add to the random gallery, but – much like time itself – that offer has passed.

## Create your own selfies

Go to http://pixelfies.us/YOURTWITTERHANDLE. Example: [http://pixelfies.us/jennschiffer](http://pixelfies.us/jennschiffer) is mine!

If your Twitter avatar isn't a selfie, you should feel bad. jk I love you.
